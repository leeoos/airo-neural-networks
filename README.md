# Neural Networks

### Objective

The purpose of this homework is to implement a new layer inside PyTorch, by properly extending the `nn.Module` object. **Before proceeding**, carefully read the following documentation:

+ [nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html?highlight=module#torch.nn.Module)
+ [PyTorch: Custom Module](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/polynomial_module.html)

You can also (optionally) learn more about activation functions by reading the survey in [1].
